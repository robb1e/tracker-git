# Tracker::Git

Update Pivotal Tracker depending on your local Git repository. 

This gem finds all finished stories and bugs and if it finds the story id in a Git commit, marks that story as delivery. 

This has proved useful as part of a 'deploy to staging' strategy. If you automatically deploy to a staging environment after a successful continuous integration build, and want to update a story from 'finished' to 'delivered', then this Gem is for you.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'tracker-git'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tracker-git

## Usage

This gem will create a 'tracker' binary. Call that in your deploy script with
the tracker id and access token as command line arguments, or with following
environment variables set, and your finished stories will be updated to
delivered.

    export TRACKER_PROJECT_ID=123456
    export TRACKER_TOKEN=abc123

Optionally you can specify a git branch to search for completed story IDs as
the third command line argument or with the GIT\_BRANCH environment variable.
